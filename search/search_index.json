SideStore resigns apps with your personal development certificate, and then uses a specially designed VPN in order to trick iOS into installing them. SideStore will periodically \"refresh\" your apps in the background, to keep their normal 7-day development period from expiring. SideStore's goal is to provide an untethered sideloading experience.
